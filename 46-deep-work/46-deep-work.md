The author describes __Deep Work__ as an increasingly rare __ability to focus intensely over a long period of time__, in order to solve complicated problems. He says that by acquiring this skill you will not only make yourself sought after in today's economy, it also leads to a __better quality of life__ in general. If you're more of a scatterbrain, don't despair - the ability to perform deep work is something that can be learned, it __needs to be trained like a muscle__.

## The idea

In the first part, Cal explains why he thinks that Deep Work is

 - rare
 - valuable
 - meaningful

While the first two aspects are pretty much evident if you're familiar with the absurdly chaotic nature of even progressive workplaces, the third one resonated most with me. I think this is connected to my reservations about "success" - while the scarcity and value of Deep Work is something that can be monetized, __meaningfulness__ is a different, more __personal measure of "success"__. This is important, because it elevates Deep Work above the level of being just another self-optimization fad - it's a a genuine approach towards both __realizing your potential__ and __being yourself__.

I was often reminded of the concept of __mindfulness__, because that too can help you finding meaning even in mundane tasks. The author described how a sword maker operates - he has to be alert over a long period of time, otherwise the sword might break, rendering the whole effort pointless. Forging the sword is more or less repeatedly banging on a piece of metal - but __immersing yourself__ in the process and __envisioning the finished product__ gives meaning to every beat of the hammer.

This aspect of __Flow__ is something that I'm also seeking constantly, even in apparently simple tasks there is often so much to learn, things that spark my curiosity, things that just lie beneath the surface and beg to be discovered, things that keep me focused for a long time.

## The rules

In the second part of the book Cal starts by describing __routines__ and __rituals__ for different philosophies of Deep Work

 - __monastic__: radically minimize shallow obligations - only an option for a few
 - __bimodal__: retreat to a quiet place for a longer time, as challenges arise
 - __rhythmic__: do only short units of Deep Work, but scheduled, every day
 - __journalistic__: do Deep Work whenever you have the opportunity - very hard

He mentions Carl Jung, the swiss psychologist, who employed the bimodal philosophy. He still worked regularly in Zurich in his practice, but built his own __retreat__ himself (!) for when he felt he needed to focus - at the time he was intensely competing with Sigmund Freud academically. The retreat is Bollingen Tower near lake Zurich, where he would __be undisturbed__, could __go for walks__ and work on the __big questions__. _(Here is a [wonderful travel report](https://medium.com/@calypsobase/visiting-carl-jungs-tower-in-bollingen-4cafe8e52636) on a visit to the tower with beautiful photos)_

Another great idea in this chapter is the [Eudaimonia Machine](https://www.workfront.com/blog/eudaimonia-machine-blueprint-virtual-workplace), a concept of a workplace where deep work is a first-class citizen. It is a sequence of rooms that are suited for various levels of depth, culminating in __chambers__ for deep focus, __sparsely furnitured single rooms__ where Deep Work is done. In contrast, in today's workplaces the __open-plan office is a monoculture__, it only allows for a single mode of work, a mode dominated by shallowness and distraction. But there are offices that go in the right direction, as Joel Spolsky has proved with (link: https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/09/24/bionic-office/ text:Fog Creek's office).

An idea that has really helped me by now is __scheduling every minute of your day__. The idea is not having to decide over and over again if it's time for Deep Work, but scheduling it in advance rigorously. Cal describes that this technique helped him to get lots of Deep Work done, __without having to sacrifice evenings and weekends__. He advises to not take breaks from distraction, but to take breaks from focus. __Focus should be your default work mode__, everything else should be minimized over time.

There are also many compelling reasons for __quitting Social Media__. I especially like what Cal calls the __any-benefit mindset__ - using a tool that has minor benefits, without considering the disadvantages. Instead one should weigh pros and cons meticulously, and only adopt what is really essential. This is a reason why I no longer use Facebook - while it was nice to be in touch with classmates again, it was an overall shallow experience without any real benefit.

## Conclusion

It somehow feels like Deep Work is something of a __dying art form__, which makes me sad. It is hardly ever encouraged to go deep. Even universities are like schools nowadays, where you hurry and learn just for the credit points.

Where will the solutions to the urgent problems come from? What about decelerating global warming, mending the fragile social peace and stopping the rise of fascism? We need people who think deep and solve the big questions, and __design sustainable systems for the future__ that will replace the current status quo, which is no longer working.

On a smaller level, I will humbly try to __re-learn the skills of Deep Work__, by scheduling more dedicated Deep Work units. It may sound cynical, but the pandemic has helped me here - I was way more productive at home than in the office over the last few months.

In the future, I hope I will also have the energy to __promote__ Deep Work and __support__ efforts to do Deep Work in my professional environment. I think it's immensely beneficial - for both employers and employees.

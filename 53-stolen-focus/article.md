# Stolen Focus (Johann Hari, 2022)

Since I have taken on a new position recently, I have had to deal with a more __fragmented work schedule__. I used to work closely with a small team of software developers, doing remote mob programming, which is awesome for focused work.

I'm now working as an architect with two teams and their stakeholders, communicating at __different levels of abstraction__ and having a lot __more, albeit smaller tasks__ to deal with. I also have to find time for defining and working on strategically important, __long-term goals__.

To be honest, it's a challenge if you're trying to make a difference, and I regularly __struggle__. In search of focus I found this book on social media, of all places. Oh, the irony.

## Stolen Focus

The book starts out with the author's self-observation of his own decline in attention and focus. He simply couldn't get his writing done. It was so bad, he went on a three-month __digital detox__ away on a remote island. While he learned a lot about his habits and managed to become productive again, his routine again slowly declined afterwards. So while there are a lot of things we as individuals can do, it's hard and never enough.

Johann Hari continues by describing the __business models of social media companies__, and compares keeping focus with a battle of the individual against thousands of the smartest engineers in the silicon valley - it can't be won. For instance, he describes technologies like __infinite scrolling__ in contrast to the __conditioning__ experiments conducted by behaviorist B.F. Skinner. In the end, the sole purpose of social media is to keep you glued to the screen as long as possible, to show you as many ads as possible. It's about __screen time, not life-time__.

But this book is not about bashing social media companies. Hari shows that the trend of declining attention can be traced back to the 19th century, and the rise of capitalism and the philosophy of __economic growth__. He argues, that attention is just another resource that is being recklessly __exploited__ - without considering the consequences, like people being susceptible to manipulation and unable to deal with __real crises__, like global warming.

## Cruel optimism

Unfortunately, these problems are mostly addressed in a superficial manner. Hari mentions the phenomenon of __cruel optimism__, a common, cynical way of offering overly optimistic and simplistic solutions to complex societal problems to individuals. Take for example the rise of yoga and meditation classes in the enterprise context, where a stress-inducing system burdens the individual with solving the problem themselves.

## Hypervigilance

I really like how the book opens up in the second half and shows how __sleep__ quality, __diet and nutrition__, or the way we __raise our children__ factor in this equation. I especially liked his mentioning of __hypervigilance__, a trait often found in traumatized people. Hypervigilant people are having a hard time to focus because their nervous system is much more __sensitive__ to minor impulses from the outside, which are perceived as threats. They are also more susceptible to __addiction__.

## Attention Rebellion

However, this is __not a self-help book__. There are no 10-point-plans or easy life hacks. It's a great collection of __studies and expert interviews__, that helps you see the bigger picture. Keeping your ability to focus and concentrate is an uphill battle. Johann Hari hopes for __political movements__, some kind of Attention Rebellion, to fight for __regulation__ and __de-growth__ in general.

Johann Hari manages to take an __unembellished look__ at the situation and draw a __clear, compelling picture__. This clarity has helped me at least to be more __self-compassionate__, be clearer about my __goals__, work on establishing __routines__, and first and foremost, __not worry__ too much. And that's fine - no cruel optimism here!

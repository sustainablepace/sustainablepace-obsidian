It must have been in early 1994 when my friend Tibi gave me his copy of [Rage Against The Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWXazVhlyxQ)'s self-titled debut album. My mind was blown. This was music transcending the genres I was used to, it was not Rock, not Heavy Metal, not Rap. In fact I had never heard anything remotely similar up to that point - I didn't even know if I liked it at first!

The name of the band is well chosen - fuelled by the raw, explosive lead vocals, the music transports an irresistibly positive, energizing anger, which totally fit my state of mind at age sixteen. I didn't even need to understand the lyrics, and only years later learned what they actually sang about.

The essence of the songs are the melodic and catchy, yet groovy riffs, both by guitar and bass. The drums are minimalistic but make it impossible to not start moving. The songwriting is extremely dynamic, with well-timed breaks, atmospheric slower parts, gradual build-ups, and then wild eruptions.

When listening to this album I feel alert, and alive. Sometimes I need music that just punches me right in the face!

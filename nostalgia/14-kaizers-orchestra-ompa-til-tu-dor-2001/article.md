Around the year 2000 I was heavily into Tom Waits' music, to the point where I was collecting live recordings of his concerts. Back then this had to be done by mailing recorded CDs in padded envelopes back and forth with dozens of fellow enthusiasts across the whole world, like Iceland, the Netherlands, Wales, Norway, the USA, China, and even Oberpleis! This offline network was a great source of learning of all kinds of other strange music.

I don't remember who of them actually introduced me to Kaizers Orchestra. Their genre-defying style could be described as post-apocalyptic norwegian-language polka. They used to perform wearing suit, tie and gas masks, and employed full-fledged manual sirens on stage. My tastes were pretty adventurous back then, and they delivered. Their debut album, the title meaning "dance till you drop", is a energizing tour-de-force of strangeness. Despite the title track, I especially love the closing track [Mr. Kaizer, hans Constanze og meg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKujC1NbbZ8), a heartfelt crooner about World War II resistance.

In 2004, I took my then-girlfriend to one of their shows at Luxor in Köln, and she still married me the following year. Later that year, in November, I stumbled over the band members once again, in the most fitting location, at "Theater des Westens" in Berlin. After an amazing Tom Waits concert I was stumbling out into the lobby, and bumped right into them. We exchanged smiles, I subtly said hello and thanked them for the Köln show, and then we continued on our own collective highs after having just seen Tom Waits.

Amazing how things sometimes come full circle.

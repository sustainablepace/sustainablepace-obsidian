Lode Runner was one of the first games I played on a __Commodore 64__ in the 1980s. So far I had only played games on the Atari 2600 video game console, but the Commodore 64 was a full-fledged computer! I guess I first played it at my friend Jochen's house. It took ages to load the game from the __tape__, and we eagerly watched the counter on the tape deck spin, while the screen flickered erratically. When the title screen came up, and we finally played the [first level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYsabZXbxOM), I was immediately blown away. It was __truly magical__!

Of course, the tape wasn't an original, but just a __copy__. In those days, games were shared similar to music, on mixtapes you made for your friends. Tapes were __traded__ in school during breaks, and it was one of the few reasons I liked going to school.

## Your mission

You play a white stick figure, a lode runner, who has to retrieve a set of __boxes__, distributed in a __maze of platforms and ladders__. Once you have collected all boxes, an escape ladder appears at the top of the screen, leading to the next, totally different maze. Each maze is defended by a group of __guards__, who are trying to catch you. Beware, they can __kill__ you with a single touch!

Fortunately, you're in possession of a weapon that can __drill holes__ in the brick platforms, where you can __trap__ the guards. Unless they climb out of there in time, they get squashed when the hole seals itself automatically after a certain time. But every guard that has been killed is immediately replaced by a new guard at the top of the screen.

You can also use subsequent drills to create elaborate __tunnels__, in order to reach boxes that are hidden behind several layers of bricks. But you need to precisely plan your tunnels, you can easily get stuck - unlike the guards, you can't climb out of a hole. But you can jump through holes on brick platforms to evade incoming guards!

The whole game is a __rapid flow of decisions__, whether to go left or right, up or down, dig a hole or not, or whether to trap a guard or jump through a hole. You need to both plan ahead and make quick decisions!

Remember, when the game was created in 1982, there were __no established genres__. Each game was another exciting experiment. Lode Runner was a great combination of a platform and puzzle game, where both __dexterity__ and __logic__ was needed to win.

## A nihilistic experience

What we didn't know then, was that the game had a __back story__: the evil Bungeling empire had stolen the gold of your people, and your mission is to retrieve the gold from them. But we didn't need to know, the game conveys this setup through its __minimalistic, chilling atmosphere__.

Unlike the worlds of Nintendo's games a few years later, this game exudes a nihilistic, indifferent atmosphere. The platforms are simple, plain brick structures against a dark, empty background. It feels like an __underground world__, far away from home.

The __sound effects__ are sparse, but effective. When you fall off a platform, the squeaky glissando feels like a spine-tingling scream. And when you're caught by a guard, all you hear is a dull, suffocating bleep, and you feel all life is being sucked out of you.

The __animation__ of the stick figures is surprisingly smooth. By making the protagonist significantly faster than the sluggish, zombie-like guards, you really feel like a __hero__, making daring runs and narrow escapes from the evil antagonists who frequently __outnumber__ you.

But you are definitely a __vulnerable, expendable__ hero. When the guards have you __surrounded__ and draw nearer, and you realize there is no way out, you feel utterly helpless. Also, realizing you are stuck in one of your self-made tunnels, and seeing the walls slowly sealing up, you're overwhelmed by __claustrophobia__.

The game also speaks of __"men" and not "lives"__, so it really feels like a perilous mission. Some mazes can only be solved by __trial-and-error__, and you lose man after man. It's an alien, hostile, desolate world that is trying to kill you. You need to build up your skills in order to __survive__. You always need to be alert, __every move matters__.

It's an incredibly intense experience!

## The 1980s, an information wasteland

You can't imagine how little information on computer games was out there in the 1980s. There were no Let's Play's, we just __took turns and watched each other play__. But you could find out about games in stores, like Kaufhof or Quelle. Those were rare treats for me, and the only reason I accompanied my mother when she went shopping.

But there were also a few magazines. I remember buying the 1986 special edition of __Happy Computer__, the first that focused exclusively on games. I had that magazine in the 80s, and it was a bible to me. And I still have it to this day, it's one of the few possessions I really care for.

## Revisit Lode Runner

Good news! __You can still play Lode Runner today.__ Simon Hung has made an incredible (link: https://loderunnerwebgame.com/LodeRunner/ text:web port of the original game). I couldn't resist playing through all 150 levels again. You can also play the follow-up games like Championship Lode Runner, and choose between the Commodore and the Apple version.

__Try it!__ It's still an awesome game.

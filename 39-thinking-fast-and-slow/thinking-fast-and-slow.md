_This book was referenced in so many other stuff I was reading, so I finally bought and read it._

## Fast and slow ##

The premise of Kahneman's book is that there are __two different modes of thinking__: a faster, low-energy, __intuitive mode__, and a slower, high-energy, __rational mode__. The fast mode is best at basic cognitive stuff, like driving a car on an empty road and reading traffic signs, while the slow mode is essential for non-trivial stuff, like parallel parking or multiplying large numbers.

The fast mode is generally used over the slow mode, simply because it consumes less energy.

Fast mode being the default mode can be problematic because it easily leads to wrong conclusions, a popular example is the __Müller-Lyer-Illusion__, where two lines of the same length are considered to be of different length.

Fast mode is also the fallback or "eco" mode: Imagine solving a complex problem at work, a slow mode activity - afterwards you will feel drained, and you are forced into fast mode because there is no energy left. You will have less self-control, will be easily annoyed or might say things you wouldn't say otherwise: This is what Kahneman calls __Ego Depletion__.

## Where fast mode is failing ##

Fast mode used to be sufficient to get us through the day, but things today are more complex than a few hundred thousand years ago. Fast mode easily leads to wrong conclusions, it can convincingly generate plausible stories from input of limited quantity and quality (Kahneman calls this WYSIATI - __what you see is all there is__). Here are just a few examples where fast mode leads to wrong decisions

 - __Priming__ - decisions can be easily influenced by a given context. For example, given the word "eat", the word "so_p" is more likely to be interpreted as "soup" rather than "soap".
 - __Halo Effect__ - imagine a teacher grading a student who has performed well in the past more favorably than someone who has not. You will also favor job interviewees who leave a good first impression.
 - __Cognitive Ease__ - we are easily convinced by things that are understandable or sound familiar.
 This explains why living in filter bubbles is so comfortable and Fake News is on the rise.
 - __Framing__ - different ways of presenting identical information - for example advertising food by saying it has _10% fat_ versus saying it is _90% fat-free_. The latter sounds way better.
 - __Substitution__ - not answering a difficult question, but answering a simple question instead and considering them equal. For example, people are likely to vote for political candidates who just _look like_ typical leaders.

Kahneman continues to explain how easily wrong decisions are made on the basis of questionable __heuristics and cognitive biases__.

 - __Small Numbers__ - a small sample size will lead to extreme results. Kahneman shows how increased cancer rates are more likely in small counties, not because there are fewer doctors or hospitals, but just because the sample size is smaller.
 - __Anchoring__ - the answer to a question is usually close to an initial suggestion. In a salary negotiation the initial offer is usually low (if it's too low one should directly abort negotiations to get rid of the anchor).
 - __Availability__ - for example overestimating the risk of a terrorist attack simply because there is lots of news coverage about terrorism.
 - __Regression to the mean__ - an observation like _"depressed children treated with an energy drink improve significantly over time"_ is actually valid - but only because their level of depression was extreme and they are more likely to return to a normal level.

Kahneman dedicates a whole chapter to the phenomenon of __overconfidence__. This is remarkable because a strong confidence is usually associated with successful leaders - it is a valued trait and has a positive connotation. Maybe this is because the stories of unsuccessful confident leaders are never told. Here are some of Kahneman's findings

 - __Hindsight__ - for example believing in a success story without considering luck - they are called "stories" for a reason. Kahneman debunks books like [Good To Great](good-to-great) that describe what successful companies have in common, without looking at the ones that failed (usually the successful and unsuccessful are all alike).
 - __Illusion Of Validity__ - for example believing you are a great trader just because you can come up with a recipe for success based on your latest investments. In chaotic environments like the stock market it mostly comes down to luck.
 - __Intuitive Experts__ - Kahneman admits there is such a thing, but only under specific circumstances like having invested 10,000+ hours in a domain. Usually algorithms and formulas are making better predictions than experts.
 - __Planning Fallacy__ - it's easy to ignore competitors or disregard previous experience. And even a well-made plan seldom accounts for "unknown unknowns".
 - __Sunk-Cost Fallacy__ - for example investing in a dropping stock over and over again, to neutralize losses and avoiding regret. It's better to sell losing stocks and keep winners.

## Prospect Theory ##

This is the field where Kahneman won the Nobel prize in 2002. He basically debunks most of Economics, which used to model human behaviour as solely rational. I have written about similar things in my review of [Animal Spirits](animal-spirits).

In contrast to the concept of Expected Value, Prospect Theory states that __value is not linear but an asymmetric curve__, that is __more sensitive to losses than gains__. I still remember being taught Expected Value theory in my Economics classes at the University - it felt overly simplified then and this is why.

The right-hand side can be explained by looking at similar data in a table.

For actors with lots of wealth, a decrease by a fixed amount results in a smaller loss of psychological value (or utility units in the table) than for actors with little wealth. A wealth drop by one point, for example, is experienced

 - by a __poorer__ person as a __loss of 18 utility units__ (wealth drops from 3 to 2)
 - by a __richer__ person as a __loss of only 6 utility units__ (wealth drops from 9 to 8)

The reference point (being rich or poor) was totally ignored in previous theories. I liked how Kahneman uses this to explain why insurances are sold by rich people to poor people: In low probability scenarios with high losses actors are risk averse, this is why poor people pay premium to transfer the risk to rich people.

## Possibility and Certainty Effect

__Loss Aversion__ is also a core finding of __Prospect Theory__. Actors would rather not lose $10 than earning $10. In the following table Kahneman identifies four scenarios that explain when actors are risk seeking and when risk averse.

![[gains_losses.jpg]]

The __Certainty Effect__ describes that people are willing to pay to reduce risk in the context of high probability winnings - actors rather choose a 100% chance to win $10,000 than a 95% chance to win $12,000. In the context of losses actors are risk seeking - imagine owning a stock that has decreased significantly in value: you will try hard to avoid losses are willing to buy over and over again to lower your overall price.

The __Possibility Effect__ can best be described as a lottery ticket in the gains scenario: Actors are willing to pay just to have a chance to win a large price. The experienced value increase from a 0% to a 1% chance of winning is a lot higher than an increase from 1% to 2%. In the losses scenario, people are again risk averse, this is the "buying insurance" scenario.

### Endowment Effect ###

Another interesting finding - it describes that people are rating things they own with a higher value than things they do not own. If you wanted to see your favourite musician perform, and tickets cost $100, you would for example be willing to pay $200, but would only be willing to sell for a value of, say, $1000. There is also a famous experiment where people are randomly given a chocolate bar or a coffee mug, and are later offered to exchange the gift for the other. A huge majority sticks with the gift they were given in the first place.

## Conclusion ##

For me it was fascinating to see how easily poor decisions are made. It helps to understand that, while fast mode offers significant upsides like conserving energy, it is also insufficient to solve complex problems that are more frequent today - the __number of simple jobs is simply shrinking__, and most jobs that could be done by fast mode are now done by machines. Although fast mode is genius because of its simplicity, I argue that __you need slow mode more than ever today__.

The other major takeaway for me was to be more careful with the energy I expend. It's essential to __avoid Ego Depletion__ and I would rather work less than make poor decisions. I think __meditation__ is also helpful to identify when you are switching from fast mode to slow mode and back. My hope is that with some training I can become more aware of the mode I'm currently in.

I guess the knowledge about the different modes will help me to be __more compassionate__ with fellow human beings in the long run. Face it, almost everyone will never care about their current mode. So I will try to be __more patient__, taking the steam out of heated discussions, allowing for pauses and breaks, and making sure there is enough energy in everyone to allow for a __rational dialogue__.

_(I still have the book here, I will gladly give it away to anyone interested in this topic)_

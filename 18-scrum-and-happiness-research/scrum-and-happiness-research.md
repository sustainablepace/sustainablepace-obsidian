# Scrum and Happiness Research

In contrast to conventional economic theories, in which utility is solely modeled as a good (like money) and people base their decisions on rationality alone, happiness research introduces another aspect of utility, called **procedural utility**. It doesn't measure the result of a process, but assumes that utility is also generated as a byproduct. 

For example, a typical aspect of procedural utility is the experience of fairness, for example, in democracies compared to dictatorships: People may not live differently in any of the above, but the feeling alone of having a say has been measured as contributing to well-being. Or think of the different ways of price-generation in markets: forbidding cartels or monopolies lets people assume a price is fair, even though it might not be different without these laws.

Psychologists have identified three main sources of procedural utility
- **Autonomy**
- **Relatedness**
- **Competence**


**Autonomy** means that you are in charge of your actions and are not controlled by other individuals or institutions. **Relatedness** is the desire to be connected to others, being a respected member of social groups. **Competence** is the feeling of being capable and to be in control of the situations you are in.

To me, the parallels to Scrum are obvious. In Scrum you are part of a self-organizing team, which allows the experience of autonomy. No other party interrupts during a sprint, and the team is responsible for its actions. Being part of that team caters to the need of relatedness. It's not up to an individual to solve a problem, people can rely on each other and support each other. The exchange of ideas in a cross-functional team results in steady learning, which presumably fosters not only relatedness, but also competence. If you are stuck with a problem, you easily feel isolated, but within a team these situations should not be an individual's burden. So it's not only competence, but also the absence of helplessness.

So Scrum is not only a way to become more efficient, it's also designed to enhance well-being. I think it's important to have both aspects in mind when introducing Scrum. Its purpose lies not exclusively in finding a better way to make people go faster, but also in respecting and trusting people in order to build long-term relationships, which results in continuous win-win situations. I truly believe that these long-term benefits will become measurable in future economic models.

# Experiments

You may have read my thoughts on [Slack](slack) being a [pillar of Sustainable Pace](what-is-sustainable-pace): Slack is the time when you are 0% busy and you have time to reinvent yourself and experiment. In case you don't have time, create time by making a [not-to-do-list](not-to-do-list). This sounds nice in theory, but how about practice? I'm going to boost my ability to change by a more disciplined and accountable approach to experimenting!

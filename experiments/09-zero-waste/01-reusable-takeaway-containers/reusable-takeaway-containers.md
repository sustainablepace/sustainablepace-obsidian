# Reusable takeaway containers

Result: Success

During the pandemic with its long stretches of homeschooling, ordering takeaway food had been a godsent. Unfortunately, a delicious meal is usually followed by a plastic and tinfoil hangover. So today's experiment is the hedonist's way of going zero waste: ordering takeaway in reusable containers!

## Vytal ##

The Cologne-based startup [Vytal](https://www.vytal.org/) collaborates with [dozens of restaurants in my hometown Bonn](https://www.vytal.org/cities/bonn-beste-restaurants-essen-mitnehmen-corona-vytal). The process works like this

 - __Download__ the Vytal app
 - __Order__ takeaway food in a partner restaurant and __add your personalized Vytal token__ into the comments section of your online order
 - Your order is now being prepared and put into Vytal containers
 - __Pick up__ your order at the partner restaurant, where the __staff scans the barcodes__ of the containers, and a personalized QR code in your Vytal app
 - After your meal, __clean up and return__ the empty containers in any partner restaurant within two weeks

## Let's do this ##

For my birthday I had received a gift certificate for our favourite sushi place. Now was the perfect opportunity to use it, as the restaurant supports the Vytal system. At first the whole process felt a little confusing, because some restaurants allow ordering from within the Vytal app, while others don't. It took me a while to understand I needed to order from the restaurant's website, and enter the token in the comments section.

The pickup process worked pretty smoothly. The friendly staff at the restaurant was also new to the system, but we figured it out together. I was amused they offered me a paper bag for all the bowls, which I smugly declined, having brought my own bag. The bowls made a pretty solid impression, and the food was still hot when I got home ten minutes later.

In the meantime the app realized I now was in possession of these containers, and reminded me to return them within two weeks. However, I washed them right after dinner and wanted to return them immediately. Being able to return them in any partner restaurant is super convenient, because we have one right around the corner. So five minutes later, the whole process was finished, and the app praised me.

## Summary ##

Overall, the whole experience was surprisingly convenient. I can imagine that ordering at our favourite indian restaurant, which also offers delivery, will become addictive easily. Not having produced any waste was a welcome change and felt super good! Unfortunately, there are very few partner restaurants near my workplace. Maybe this will have changed once the pandemic comes to an "end".

But now it's time to wipe that smug smile off of my face, and get serious with zero waste!

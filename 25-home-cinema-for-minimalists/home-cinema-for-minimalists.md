# A home cinema for minimalists

In our home there is no TV. We have thrown it out about five years ago and didn't regret it. But there is one aspect I miss: watching films. We used to watch films on the computer screen, but since we've moved to a bigger apartment there is no appropriate setting that allows this in a comfortable manner. 

I thought I had found the solution when acquiring a projector two weeks ago. But the day after having watched the first film in our home cinema, I was having doubts. Don't get me wrong, I was truly impressed what even low price projectors are capable of. But somehow it felt wrong. 

- I disliked that I had to wire a lot of new cables.
- I disliked the idea of having to maintain another device.
- I disliked how I needed to tell my daughter not to touch anything.
- I disliked the idea of giving money to huge consumer electronics manufacturers.
- I disliked that watching films could become a time consuming (and finally less rewarding) habit.
- I disliked having to choose from an infinite number of movies via video on demand.
- I disliked the idea that having this home cinema would keep me from going out.


The decision had been made, return the projector and get a refund. But what about watching films? I still wanted to do that! The solution was quite obvious: go to the cinema.

- I liked the idea of having a clean and minimalist home.
- I liked not having another device that could break and drive me mad.
- I liked how my daughter can enjoy playing without possibly breaking stuff.
- I liked the idea of giving money to the people in my home town.
- I liked having less habits and more slack time.
- I liked the idea of having only a limited selection of movies.
- I liked the idea of sharing an experience with other people in the cinema.

In Bonn we have three great cinemas, [Bonner Kinemathek](http://www.bonnerkinemathek.de/), [Rex and Neue Filmb√ºhne](http://www.rex-filmbuehne.de/) (plus the annual [silent film festival](http://www.internationale-stummfilmtage.de/)). From now on, I will refer to each of these cinemas as my home cinema.

Maybe there's a film you want to see? Let me know and I'll tag along.

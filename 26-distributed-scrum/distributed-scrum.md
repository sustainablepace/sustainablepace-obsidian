# Distributed Scrum

Last night I listened to the latest episode of Software Engineering Radio, ["Distributed Scrum"](http://www.se-radio.net/2011/12/episode-181-distributed-scrum-with-rini-van-solingen/), with Rini van Solingen. Having worked on open source projects and having mentored in Google Summer of Code for three years, I've had my share of distributed teams, but I have never done distributed Scrum, so I was interested.

I've heard of Rini van Solingen through Jeff Sutherland's translation of his book ["The Power of Scrum"](http://www.scruminc.com/news-details/items/POS_Kindle_Announcement.html). It's not your generic Scrum book, it is novel with a proper narrative. Rini described that a fiction book is better suited at managers as stories appeal more to them than theory. Also, it doesn't focus on the artifacts of Scrum, but on the effects. I haven't read it, but it's supposed to be a quick two hour read.

At the start of the show the host and Rini tried to define what distributed really means. There were different approaches, I agreed with the criteria **a distance over 30 meters**. It doesn't really matter if you are 30 meters or 3000 kilometers apart, your chance of collaboration is highly diminished beyond a few meters.

Rini argued that this gap can be bridged by lowering the perceived distance. For example he mentioned [Sococo](https://www.sococo.com/home.php), a company that offers virtual offices, where people hook up with their headphones and microphone, and whenever they enter a virtual room, they only hear the people who are also in this very room. You can also put up information radiators like Scrum or Kanban boards in these virtual offices. I would really love to try that.

You also have to take cultural differences into account. I learned this through Google Summer of Code, where some students were rather polite than honest. At that time, I wasn't really aware of this being a cultural thing.

So what did I learn, with respect to Scrum? The focus should be on the people, not the artifacts. Rini even said that he favored having a Scrum board in every location instead of just a single one, so the teams are forced to keep each other up to date. First and foremost, **letting the team work things out for themselves** seems to be more promising then imposing rules and reglementation.

In the end, face to face time is still crucial according to Rini. I laughed at his quote, that **a group of people is not a team unless they got drunk in the same location at the same time**. When I think of conferences or code sprints I have been to, this rings a bell. There is no technology yet that can replace sharing a common experience in real life.

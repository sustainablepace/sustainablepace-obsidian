_(This is something I wanted to build a few years ago. Unfortunately it never materialized. I still think it's a cool idea!)_

## What's wrong with Facebook, Twitter, etc? ##

Thanktuary appreciates the value social networks have brought to the world, but wants to address the following problems they have

### Too much content ###

It's not unusual for an average social network user to be exposed to hundreds of status updates each day. It takes a lot of time and energy to filter out interesting information. It's easy to __feel afraid of missing out__. 

### Unlimited activity ###

You can always add another status update, comment, or upload another photo. Most people have several hundred contacts, and are trying to attract more. __It's never enough__. Some people find it hard to find an exit when browsing social network sites.

### Too much self-obsession ###

The focus on social network sites is always on you. The idea is to create an interesting profile or timeline, in order to attract and maintain a large audience. People easily feel obliged to regularly updating their profiles, and feel they need to __live up to an image__ they have created of themselves.

## So what about Thanktuary? ##

In the world of social networks, Thanktuary acts as a sanctuary - a __safe__ place for __gratitude__ and __meaningful__ interactions. The core idea is simple:

- Thank five people per week. And you're done!

### It saves your time ###

On other social networking sites, you need to create and maintain a profile, and keep up with status updates and timelines.

On Thanktuary, your profile is a summary of all thank you's you have received. Therefore __you can't edit your own profile__! And you will only receive a single status update per week. 

### It improves your relationships ###

On other social networking sites, you can use an unlimited number of "likes" or "stars", which significantly lowers their value. 

On Thanktuary, you can only use a __limited__ number of thank you's (5) per week, making it a more __meaningful__ way of giving attention.

### It makes you happy ###

On other social networking sites, you try to attract attention by making yourself look good.
On Thanktuary, you can only give attention and __make others look good__. Giving is a key factor in determining happiness.

### It is a meditiation exercise ###

Thanktuary directs your __focus__ to a single thing: Think about the people that made you happy, and thank them for this. In a world of distraction, Thanktuary offers a place of __quiet__ and __contemplation__.

_(Feel free to use the idea and the name.)_

# Working Out Loud and the Five Ways to Well-being

As I have volunteered to do a workshop on [Working Out Loud](working-out-loud) in July I'm thinking more about why it seems to work almost effortlessly. In his book, John Stepper mentions the relationship to __intrinsic motivation__ and its contributing factors like __autonomy__, __competence__ and __relatedness__. A long time ago I've written a [summary of Bruno Frey's book Happiness](happiness) that also touches these issues.

At that time I was also interested in what the [New Economics Foundation (nef](http://neweconomics.org/)) released as "The Five Ways to Well-Being".

They identified five core activities that contribute to well-being: __Connect__, __Be active__, __Take notice__, __Keep learning__, __Give__. Read more about it in the [PDF](https://b.3cdn.net/nefoundation/8984c5089d5c2285ee_t4m6bhqq5.pdf) document.

Looking back now, I find it interesting that the reinforcing habit loop in Working Out Loud also consists of five pillars.

Of course this is totally coincidental, but it triggered me to look at them side by side. And with some imagination, I think the five pillars of Working Out Loud and the Five Ways to Well-Being line up quite nicely

__Purposeful discovery__ is about being mindful and curious, and about choosing the next step or experiment carefully, taking previous feedback and learnings into consideration. Sometimes opportunities present themselves in a subtle way, so it's important to __take notice__.

__Building relationships__ is about investing time in them and developing them. It fits nicely with __Connect__.

__Making you and your work visible__ is about working on your goals and actually getting things done. __Be active__ was meant more in context of physical exertion, but I think creating also falls into this category.

__Leading with generosity__ is about shifting the focus to what you can do for others, and not what can others do for you. I think __Give__ is a natural fit here.

__A growth mindset__ is about shifting the focus to getting "better" instead of getting "good". Be bold and ambitious, try to improve and take in feedback. __Keep learning__ is also close to Purposeful discovery, especially because it is about trying something new - as these steps are adjacent, they feel a little interchangeable.

Of course this is __borderline pseudo-science__, but it is interesting to note that each step in Working Out Loud can somehow contribute to a person's well-being. And as Working Out Loud works best if none of the five pillars are neglected, people internalizing the habits have a good chance of living a __balanced life__, focusing on a set of activities that all contribute to well-being.

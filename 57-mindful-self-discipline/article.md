I have always considered myself the __creative genius type__ who achieves everything through curiosity, intuition and intrinsic motivation. However, at my current job I frequently have to deal with things that just need to be done - mostly __annoying small tasks__ that are neither inspiring nor particularly interesting.

When I fail to get them out of the way, they cloud the big picture of what I really want to achieve, to the point where I __feel overwhelmed__ and __limited in my impact__. At one point last year, I felt the sudden need to have more self-discipline, and found this book by Giovanni Dienstmann (what a fitting name for a self-discipline author). As an owl, the elaborate description of morning routines turned me off at first, but finally the book has won me over!

The premise of mindful self-discipline is about being a __monk rather than a soldier__ - not focused on brutal, cold focus or unquestioned loyalty, but being in sync with your aspirations, and having the awareness to follow them through with self-compassion. It's the art of living in harmony with your highest goals and values. It's a __gentler approach__ that helps you create a positive rhythm in your life. Dienstmann, who has also written an interesting meditation book, structures the process of mindful self-discipline into three pillars: Aspiration, Awareness and Action.

## Aspiration
In the aspiration phase, you connect to your __purpose__, identify your __goals__ and break them down into __milestones__. Then you create habits, by finding triggers and defining minimal actions, along with a contingency plan to deal with failure. This also contains finding a __morning routine__ and refining it over time. All this reminds me of the first few weeks of [Working Out Loud](working-out-loud).

He also suggests doing some kind of __detox__ first, like a "monk week", in order to start fresh. Apparently your ability to work on long-term goals is highly reliant on having stable levels of dopamine. Constantly giving in to __instant gratification__ can severely __imbalance your dopamine levels__, which results in fatigue and poor concentration, and ultimately ADHD and addiction. You want to get that sorted out beforehand.

## Awareness
Once you have established your goals, the methods in the awareness pillar help you stay on track. These simple practices connect you back to your aspirations and re-energize you. I liked the __Shift-Your-Focus technique__ best - by zooming out of a specific self-control conflict, it allows you to experience a strong connection to your __future self__, effectively making distractions unattractive.

__Embrace-Your-Pain__ is about labeling the urges that overcome you and stop you from reaching your goals. By reducing these urges to __bodily sensations__ and applying __self-compassion__, you give them room and let them pass. Our minds have a great desire for coherence, because it conserves energy. Discomfort can nowadays be easily soothed - by junk food, Netflix or social media - but accepting discomfort like this allows you to step out of your comfort zone __mindfully, not forcefully__.

## Action
This segment is about making progress on your goals. It goes further into habit creation, and has some great practices to stay on track. As someone who is not very skilled at self-compassion, the section on __overcoming doubts__ (either doubts in yourself, your path, or your goal) and __overcoming failure__ resonated most with me. For example, the __ALFA method__ helps you to make failures less harmful, by acknowledging what happened, learning from it, forgiving yourself and acting by recommitting and starting over.

Finally, the __Never-Zero technique__ is a great way to keep the momentum up. While motivation is important, it fluctuates - so we should not wait for the moment to "feel right" to work on our goals, but act independently of it.

## Meditation
The last part of the book has some interesting perspectives on __meditation, the self-discipline gym__, as Dienstmann calls it. He goes into different types of meditations for working on different kinds of problems. For example, he suggests doing __concentration meditation__ for __developing willpower__, in contrast to observation meditation which tends to make you passive and accepting. I need to practice these different styles myself to find out more here.

## Let's practice!
The author has also written a __workbook__, which comes for free after a registration at his website. It helps you to explicitly work on the steps described here. I have tried a few exercises myself, they reminded me a lot of the __SIY program__ I participated in last year.

This book has definitely pushed me __out of my comfort zone__. Along with the [Building a Second Brain](building-a-second-brain) approach I have now a set of actionable tools that help me improve my willpower and self-discipline. In the end, an important reminder for me is that seeking comfort as a default is a dead end. Ultimately, happiness comes from knowing you can deal with anything life throws at you, and not having to shield yourself from it by giving in to instant gratification.

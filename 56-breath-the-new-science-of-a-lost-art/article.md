# Breath - The New Science of a Lost Art (James Nestor, 2021)

James Nestor's interest in the human breath stems from his time as a __free diver__: people in this community have demonstrated that the ability to __hold one's breath__ for several minutes is a skill that can be trained, even by hobbyists. He learnt about people on Japanese islands who live off the ocean, catching octopus by hand, while diving without any breathing assistance - even women who were 80 years old!

He went on to interview __pulmonauts__ (people who use nasal breathing techniques to improve their health and capabilities) and his research delivers fascinating insights - for example, he learned about monks that can sit motionless in ice water for an hour, and heat themselves just by breathing. I myself had taken classes in Pranayama about five years ago, but this book has totally floored me.

We are breathing all our lives long, and yet know so little about it!

## Breathe slower and less - through your nose
First, you should __breathe through your nose__ at all times. This prevents many chronic health problems and helps improve athletic performance (keep your heart rate no higher than 180 minus age!). The insides of the nose are __shaped like a shell__, and its job is to keep dirt and bacteria out (so don't remove your nasal hair).

The key is breathing both __less and slowly__. Think of a rowing boat - instead of doing a gazillion uncoordinated short strokes, fewer and longer strokes will be more effective. Nestor describes how 9/11 survivors who suffered from a __chronic cough__ caused by the debris were able to significantly improve their condition just by practicing a few rounds of slow breathing a day.

An easy to remember __breathing rhythm__ (which must please the numerologists) consists of breathing in for 5.5 seconds, breathing out for 5.5 seconds, which results in 5.5 breaths per minute! He also found that lots of __traditional chants__, or __prayers__ like the rosary, somehow follow this pattern, which explains their meditative, calming effect. It can be found in cultures __all around the world__!

## Exhale longer than you inhale
Intuitive advice for a person having an asthma or panic attack is _"to take a deep breath"_. However, Nestor describes that, surprisingly, __carbon dioxide__ plays a more important role in this scenario than oxygen. Exhaling longer than inhaling increases carbon dioxide levels, and reverts dizziness, shortness of breath or feelings of suffocation. So, _"hold your breath"_ might be a better tip.

Nestor also mentions that __professional cyclists__ typically have a inhale-exhale ratio of two by five. And if you have trouble __falling asleep__, a common breathing pattern that helps you relax is breathing in for three seconds, holding the breath for four, and exhaling for seven seconds. If you're into technology, there are __hundreds of apps__ that you can finetune to help you keep a rhythm that works for you.

## Mouth-breathing
When watching the Netflix series "Stranger Things" with my daughter, I was entertained by the character Eleven learning to label the idiots she encounters as _"mouth-breathers"_ - but there is a lot of truth to this! In fact, breathing through the mouth is not uncommon in western societies. It leads to __snoring__, and even __sleep apnea__ - a nicer word for __suffocating__, when you should be resting.

Nestor describes an experiment he and a fellow pulmonaut did at Stanford University, where their __noses were sealed shut__ for ten days. With shocking results, it didn't take long for their heart rates to increase, them being exhausted much faster, and their cognitive abilities to decrease.

Apparently, nutrition plays a huge role here - in western societies we eat lots of __soft, processed foods__. This leads to an under-utilization of the muscles in our jaws and face in general. Over time, our __mouths become smaller__, our teeth become crooked (and wisdom teeth are removed), our tongue is pushed back, and all this leaves very __little room for air__ to flow freely through the nose.

If you want to go back to nose breathing, especially in your sleep, Nestor recommends a __durable cloth tape__ (3M Nexcare Durapore) to seal your mouth shut instead. It's supposed to be comfortable, without chemical scent, not leaving any residue. I'm not much of a snorer, but I will definitely try this out.

Another easy hack is to frequently __use chewing gum__. He recommends a sugar free mint gum by Falim, a turkish brand, because it's supposed to be harder to chew than your typical gum. All this works because we are able to __grow bone tissue in our faces__ - even as adults! Nestor describes that he was able to build bone tissue the size of several small coins. This simply blew my mind!

## Breathe!
So paying more attention to your breath is absolutely worthwhile. If you're doing __yoga__, think less about what you're doing with your body, but more about how your breath flows as you move. During __meditation__, calm yourself but following a breathing rhythm that works for you.

This book is an absolute mind blower for me! I will breathe more __consciously__ from now on, and start to __exercise__. The techniques described here have been __proven to work for thousands of years__ - I guess if the pharma industry was able to sell perfect breath as a product, no one would even bother swallowing pills.

After having read [Mindful Self-Discipline](mindful-self-discipline) I wanted to learn more about the role of dopamine in this context. Fortunately I came across exactly the book I was looking for. Its author Anna Lembke is a therapist, mostly helping people who struggle with several forms of addiction.

_If you don't want to read the whole book or this blog post, this YouTube video [How to find balance in the age of indulgence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEfkx3DsXjs) is a brillant summary._

## The Pleasure-Pain Balance
Like any complex living system, the human body strives towards an __equilibrium__. Positive feedback loops are counteracted by negative feedback loops, which keep the whole system in balance. For example, if the balance tips towards either pleasure or pain, there are mechanisms in the brain that automatically bring us back to an even level.

The problem is that the human body was designed for __scarcity__. In today's industrialized world, there are endless, easily accessible opportunities to experience "pleasure", like watching porn, playing video games or eating fast food. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that is associated with experiencing pleasure. But the __repeated dopamine stimulus desensitizes us__ and we start to experience symptoms like drug addicts.

## Addiction
The negative feedback loops pile up and if consumption doesn't stop, tip the balance to the negative side. The highs become less high and we need to consume just to feel normal. We feel anxious, depressed, or experience insomnia. That's the __paradox of hedonism__, it ultimately leads to __anhedonia__, the inability to enjoy any kind of pleasure.

Only __abstinence__ can restore the dopamine balance in our bodies. Over time we are again able to get pleasure from less potent rewards. The book has some great self-binding strategies that help you to distance yourself from your drug of choice. For me, it's always been my computer - over the years I have already put elaborate measures in place in order to limit my usage. It's a constant struggle, and I have mixed success.

For example, I'm doing things like

 - __turning off wifi__ for my devices in the evening
 - __removing all notifications__ on my smartphone
 - __deleting social media accounts__, or at least always logging out after using it
 - __removing suggested videos__ on YouTube with a browser plugin
 - __having time limits__ for certain applications

## The Pursuit of Pain
In the final third, the book introduces its twist, and it's a good one. When pain is the price we pay for pleasure, then on the other hand, __pleasure is the reward for pain__! We live in a feel-good world where everyone is running from pain. What if we could look it in the eye, endure it and even seek it out in moderation?

__Meditation__ is once again a key recipe. I have [written about it before](what-do-i-gain-from-meditation). We need to learn to sit with being uncomfortable and let it pass. By reducing it to a bodily sensation, we distance ourselves from it and allow it to pass. I have now renewed my Headspace subscription and hope to establish a better routine.

Anna Lembke also describes the effects of __cold baths__, where people submerge themselves in ice-cold water. The process is utterly painful at first, but the after-effect is a gentle pleasure. Another interesting angle is __intermittent fasting__, if food is your drug of choice.

## Stop running away
Another highlight for me was the chapter on __radical honesty__. It's easy to justify your behavior if everyone else is also taking the path of cheap pleasures. Taking a clear, non-judgmental look at ones behavior patterns is not easy, but necessary if you really want to change.

The book closes with some powerful words on __immersing yourself into the world__ and into one's life, and not giving in to distractions and escapism.

As I try to follow the ideals of __elegance__ and __simplicity__ in my life, Greg McKeown's "Essentialism" got my attention. He defines essentialism as __doing less__, but focusing on the __right things__, and explains different aspects of essentialism in about 20 blog-post-sized chapters.

## Journaling and Editing

He starts with the essentialist's mindset in theory, which involves __getting in the driver's seat__ and making __choices__ for yourself, discerning important from unimportant, and continues with a few practical chapters on how to do this.

I liked the chapter called "Look" best, where McKeown uses __journalism__ as a metaphor: he describes the journalist's ability to identify the essence of a confusing, unclear situation and turning it into a news __story__. He then translates the metaphor to scripting your own life - by taking a closer, objective look, asking yourself the right questions, choosing the relevant bits, and getting yourself out there. And thus, turning your life itself into an interesting story.

He also recommends __starting a journal__ (that is what "journalism" actually is), something that quite a few have recommended to me in the past, but so far I have not done so.

In a later chapter he also uses film __editing__ as a metaphor - sometimes it's better to remove something than to add more to it. Best-picture winners at the Academy Awards have very often also won the Best-editing award!

## Saying "No"

The next part is about how to be aware of and handle the distractions, and minimizing them in order to focus on the important stuff. An important reminder to me was to __say "no"__ more often, and focus only on the things that I absolutely want to do. The __fear of missing out__ is a seductive force - even if proposals sound beneficial. McKeown recommends saying "yes" to only the top 10% opportunities you come along.

Dealing with __social pressure__ is also something that needs to be learned. If you try it, you'll find people greatly respect a reasonable "no". And it's also never too late to say "no" - it makes sense to regularly evaluate ongoing projects and pull the plug on them if they don't turn out to be rewarding. This has also been well-described in Kahneman's book [Thinking fast and slow](thinking-fast-and-slow) (endowment effect).

I also liked his idea of asking yourself this: __if the opportunity would not be there, how much would you be willing to offer to have it?__ In the end, you need to know your limits, and keep the trade-offs (the opportunity costs) in mind - you can only do so much in your life.

## Buffers and Play

The author also recommends to __block time__ regularly for the important things in your life, and stick to the plan. In these time-slots you should not only work on your goals with a high focus, but also allow __playful__ activities that do not directly contribute to a goal. These activities will often often up options that you would have missed easily. The advices here reminded me of what I read in [Deep Work](deep-work).

## Routine

In the last part McKeown gives practical advice on how to effortlessly __implement__ essentialism. The chapter on "Routine" gave me the most here, as it describes the meticulous routine of Olympic gold medal winner Michael Phelps as he prepares for a swimming competition. By sticking to the plan he builds focus and eliminates surprises and distractions.

This idea, and actually most ideas in the book, also describe what the [Working Out Loud](working-out-loud) training program does for you. And as I have written before, the idea of planning your whole day is something I took away from Deep Work, and it works quite well for me.

## Summary

All in all, there is good advice is this book. But somehow __it felt like I heard it all before__ - it feels like a blog post compilation of the top (time) management books from the last 25 years. Stylistically the author __relies on anecdotes__ a lot, which often serve as good metaphors, but it is __hardly scientific__. The chapters also overlap quite a bit. All this gives the book a shallow, unoriginal touch and undermines it genuinely interesting premise - in the end it feels like essentialism was used as a lowest common denominator for a __mixed bag of ideas__.

But then again, it is a __fast read__ and has some __sound advice__, so it's just okay for a quick Sunday afternoon read - a compilation of generally good ideas.
